Basic framework to test the board, includes pretty logging in Serial Monitor, suitable for using as a template for future projects.

Don't use, only saving JIC and will be deleted once I have the rest of the samples cleaned up and checked in.

Bunch of code jumbled together.  Not left in a working state because I realized I needed desperately to get things into source control after losing a "it all works" piece of code when I lost power during a save and it zeroed out the file.  This will get sliced and diced into further small modules that each work, then eventually all put back into one sketch.

SD card - read the contents and display in Serial Monitor.
